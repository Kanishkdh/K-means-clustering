# K-means-clustering

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.
The K-means clustering algorithm computes centroids and repeats until the optimal centroid is found. It is presumptively known how many clusters there are. It is also known as the flat clustering algorithm. The number of clusters found from data by the method is denoted by the letter ‘K’ in K-means.

In this project by using the data from the US government. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/faqs.html and tried to gain insights into similarity between countries and regions of the world by experimenting with different cluster amounts.
